# Admiral At Bot

Welcome to the world's crappiest Discord bot. I mainly made this as a friend wanted a practical joke bot and I saw this as a good opertunity to read about the Discord api. Don't come in here expecting actual engineering effort, but if you want a one function bot starting point, knock yourself out.

This bot is surprisingly used in some public discord servers as *Mr. Ping*.

## How to Run

Put API key in token.txt, run `python3 bot_core.py` in your shell, dumb simple. Requires discord re-write and Python > 3.7.

# Contributing

I'm making the source code open since I don't have time to work on features often anymore due to my life and career, but I'll try to maintain the project so feel free to submit whatever features you want. I know there was some intrest from my friend in getting other contributors in my new feature absense.
